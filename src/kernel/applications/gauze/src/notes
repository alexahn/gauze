- strict mode forces an additional render
- variables passed into props cannot update props, but if the references are the same, changes to data can be represented when a render occurs, but it does not in of itself cause a render to occur
- useState seems to track data changes, such that passing a useState variable into a prop causes the component to recalculate the prop when the useState variable is updated, changes to useState variables in and of itself cause a render to occur
- it seems react has opted to make developers explicitly declare sources of change (e.g. useState variables) as a way to figure out when to re-calculate variables
