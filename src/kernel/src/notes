rename exports from controllers and models to the convention used everywhere else?
e.g. SystemModel to SYSTEM_MODEL__MODEL__KERNEL
or should we use the PascalCase convention in all the kernel code to distinguish it from a realm?
because the kernel realm code will have exports that look like SYSTEM_MODEL__MODEL__KERNEL
if we go with the common convention we will need to update the exports to have SRC in the path, like SYSTEM_MODEL__MODEL__SRC__KERNEL

keep controllers and models how they are because i dont want to deal with the templating changes
everything else use the common convention

todo: update models and controllers to use the same export convention as the rest of the codebase
note: will need to update base_from_src and src_from_base to use the common convention, which could be a pain in the ass
