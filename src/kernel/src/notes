rename exports from controllers and models to the convention used everywhere else?
e.g. SystemModel to SYSTEM_MODEL__MODEL__KERNEL
or should we use the PascalCase convention in all the kernel code to distinguish it from a realm?
because the kernel realm code will have exports that look like SYSTEM_MODEL__MODEL__KERNEL
if we go with the common convention we will need to update the exports to have SRC in the path, like SYSTEM_MODEL__MODEL__SRC__KERNEL
